## Integrate API with Lambda

In this step, you will configure the HTTP API so that incoming requests from the client are forwarded to your Lambda function.  
API Gateway will serve as the HTTP interface for your Bedrock-powered chatbot.

---

### 🔹 Step 1 — Open the API you created

Go to **API Gateway Console** and select the API:

`bedrock-chatbot-api`
