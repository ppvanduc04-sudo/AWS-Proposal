## Create API Gateway

In this section, you will create an HTTP API on Amazon API Gateway so that clients can send questions to your Lambda function.  
API Gateway will act as the HTTP endpoint intermediary between the client and your AI Q&A service.

After completing this section, you will have a public (or private, depending on configuration) HTTP endpoint that allows clients such as Postman, cURL, or web frontends to send questions to Lambda and receive responses from Bedrock.
