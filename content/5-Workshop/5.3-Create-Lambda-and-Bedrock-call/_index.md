## Create Lambda and Call Bedrock

In this section, you will create a Lambda function and configure it to call an Amazon Bedrock model using the **Converse API**.  
The overall architecture was introduced earlier, and this step focuses on implementing the components needed for Lambda to send a prompt to Bedrock and receive a response.

---

In the following steps, you will:

1. Create a new Lambda function  
2. Assign the Execution Role you prepared in the **Prerequisites** section  
3. Write the initial code to call a model using the **Converse API**  

After completing this section, your Lambda function will be able to interact directly with Bedrock and handle AI Question–Answer requests.
