This section provides an overview of my worklog during the internship period.
The entire program was completed over 12 weeks, following a structured weekly plan with clear objectives, tasks, and deliverables.

Throughout these weeks, I gradually built the Fitness AI Training Platform, covering frontend, backend, AI motion analysis, real-time communication, database management, and cloud deployment. Each week focused on a specific part of the system, ranging from initial requirement analysis to full end-to-end testing.
Below is the list of weekly tasks and progress:
