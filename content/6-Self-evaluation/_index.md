During my internship at AWS, I participated in the development and deployment of project AI Fit Challenge.  
This experience helped me strengthen my technical skills, task management abilities, teamwork communication, and problem-solving mindset.

I consistently worked to complete assigned tasks on time, proactively learned new concepts, and welcomed feedback from my mentor to improve myself.  
Below is my personal self-evaluation based on different criteria:
