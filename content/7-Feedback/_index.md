### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is very open and friendly. Team members are always willing to provide support, which helped me adapt quickly from the very beginning. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, allowing me to focus and work more efficiently. I believe additional internal activities or team bonding sessions would help strengthen the connection between members even further.

**2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team**  
My mentor provided clear guidance, practical examples, and always encouraged me to explore and solve problems by myself before offering help. The admin team responded quickly regarding procedures, documentation, and workflow-related tasks. I truly appreciate the dedication and the supportive spirit throughout the internship.

**3. Job Relevance to My Major**  
The tasks assigned to me were closely related to what I studied at school, while also giving me the opportunity to work with new tools and technologies that I had not encountered before. This combination helped me better understand how theoretical knowledge can be applied in real-world projects.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The internship significantly improved my skills, such as requirement analysis, task management, using Cloud/DevOps tools, and working within a professional development process. My mentor also shared valuable industry insights that helped me gain a clearer direction for my future career.

**5. Team Culture & Support**  
The team maintains a positive and collaborative working culture. Everyone is responsible, supportive, and willing to share knowledge when someone needs help. This positive environment made me feel confident and comfortable while contributing to the project.
